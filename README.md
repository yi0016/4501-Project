Project for Top10 and Parking

# Description for Top10
1.	Import 311_Service_Requests_2020.csv file as df Dataframe by using pandas.
2.	Filter the dataframe to only contains data of our choosing zip code 10025 area.
3.	Review the table by using df.head() function.
4.	Find top10 incident types by using df.groupby() function, sorting values by descending order, only display top 10 cause incident types. 
5.	Check Top10 and its type as Panda.Series.

# Description for Parking
1.	Import 311_Service_Requests_2020.csv file as df Dataframe by using pandas.
2.	Review the table by using df.head() function.
3.	In order to calculate Illegal Parking incident proportion of all area and 10025 area, find total incident in all area, total incident in 10025 area, total parking incident in all area, and total parking incident in 10025 area. 
4.	Find the proportion of parking incident
-	Parking incident proportion in all area = total parking incident in all area/ total incident in all area
-	Parking incident proportion in 10025 area = total parking incident in 10025 area/ total incident in 10025 area
5.	Compare between the proportion of parking incident in all area and 10025 area, which one is highest. 
-	If the 10025 area is higher, higher_parking_proportion variable returns True.
-	Otherwise, higher_parking_proportion variable returns False.
